# NBA_Salaries_Kaggle_Competition
Kaggle Competition between fellow UCLA stats students using techniques from Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). Major operations include preprocessing data, creating new variables for regression from existing variables, perfomring MLR, logistic regression, analyzing covariates, proforming AIC/BIC, and performing transformations.

There are two fles, one with the guidelines for the Kaggle Competition and one with a report. The report contains cruical information about my approach to the competition and what my model's strengths and weaknesses were. Notably, the report contains several graphs and tables using ggplot2, the code for this in NBAVisuals.rmd. Thanks for taking an interset in my journey through my fist kaggle competition. 

P.S.
I will be particiating in another kaggle competition using more advanced data science methods that should be finished by the end of December!
